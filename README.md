# multi-arm-bandit-problem
The multi-armed bandit problem considers a resource allocation problem in partially unknown environments. 
In more detail, the problem refers to the task of allocating a fixed and limited set of resources among alternative choices 
in a way that maximizes the expected gain. Importantly, each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation
and may become better understood with time and/or by allocating resources to a choice. The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic reinforcement 
learning problem that demonstrates the exploration-exploitation tradeoff dilemma and related concepts in a clear non-associative form. As such, 
it helps set the foundations of reinforcement learning theory. The multi-armed bandit problem has also applications in various domains such as 
clinical trials and networking. In this notebook we will experiment with a number of multiarmed bandit algorithms by altering the abstract bandit algorithm.
